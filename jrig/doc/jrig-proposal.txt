Java Relational Information Generator (jrig)
===========================

The project goal is to design and implement a database sample data generator.

--------------------
Motivation
--------------------

In order to perform performance/load/stress test, it is a
pre-requisite to work against a database with substantial amount of
data that adheres to the same explicit database constraints and
implicit business rules as real production data.

It is however tremdously tedious, if not impossible, to create tens of
thousands record by hand. This is a job better left to computer.

--------------------
Implementation Language
--------------------

It is to be implemented in Java and using JDBC for database access.

--------------------
Similar Products
--------------------

DBMonster (http://dbmonster.kernelpanic.pl/) is the only similar open source
project I am aware of.

Other similar products are commercial products and most use ODBC.

The main differentiation points are

1. This project is going to offer a more sophiscated data generation
model than DBMonster's column based model.  

2. Domain Language based approach to generation rule specification rather than XML based specification.

3. More data fill modes then DBMonster's offering.
